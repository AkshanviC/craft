# craft

mkr/craft was the original server hosted originally in early 2019 and taken down in a few weeks. A new server was started in its name in April 2020.

## Rules:

The rules are guidelines and may be expanded by admins if needed at any time. In case of dispute, ping @MKRhere on the Telegram chat. Not following rules may cause me to ban you from the server. I don't have mental bandwidth to track down players and follow your every action, so I expect you to behave without intervention. Have fun and let others have fun too.

### `1)` Regarding spawn region

- `a)` "Spawn region" is a square area 700 blocks in every direction from `(x: 0, z: 0)` covering a 1400x1400 blocks.

- `b)` Current notable structures include _Wayfarer's Inn_ `(x: -186, z: 60)`, where supplies are available free to take, and beds are available to rest; _Riverport_, a small port building to the east of _Wayfarer's Inn_. On your first spawn, you're very likely to spawn directly in front of or close to the Inn.

- `c)` Spawn region is reserved for newbies and as a common region for all players. No player may permanently settle here. New players are allowed to cut trees, mine, and gather resources before they begin their journey outwards. Otherwise, spawn region is treated as a No Man's Land.

- `d)` OPs may undertake projects in spawn to improve quality of life for all players, but may not settle in the Spawn region themselves either.

### `2)` Play style

- `a)` This server was started on easy difficulty, and encourages building and exploring.

- `b)` While not a strict requirement, it's suggested to follow the server theme and build medieval style buildings, castles, and so on. I appreciate if you follow biome and server theme.

- `c)` No hacks! Any mods that give you an unfair advantage is a hack. This includes minimap mods that show mobs and caves without exploring them. If you use a minimap mod, disable cave mode. Duping, flyhacks, exploiting glitches, and other hacks and mods are disallowed.

- `d)` A server-wide map is made available publicly, but this is purely for convenience. While I will update it on request, do not spam me for the same thing.

- `e)` AFKing is not allowed. The server will kick you if you AFK for 5 minutes.

- `f)` Building mob farms and automated crop farms is fine as long as it's server-friendly, in that it does not cause lag to everyone on the server. In case one of your contraptions is killing the server, remove it yourself, or an OP will.

### `3)` Other players' bases

- `a)` Do not grief, obviously. If a region shows signs of having been occupied, don't damage or steal items. People spent time building stuff, so be respectful. You may only loot structures and villages not occupied by another player.

- `b)` You can challenge, deal with, or otherwise trade territory with other players as you please, as long as any agreement is mutual. Individuals or factions may fight over occupied land if they both agree to terms.

On the whole, enjoy playing and have common sense :)
